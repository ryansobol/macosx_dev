## Install and Configure Chrome

Now it's time to install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), a fast and free web browser that automatically updates itself with the latest web technologies.

To get started, [download Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/), open the disk image file, and drag the app icon into your `/Applications` folder.

Once installed, use Spotlight to launch Chrome by pressing the `Command` + `Spacebar` keys at the same time, typing the word "chrome" into the search field, and then pressing the `Enter` key.

**TIP:** I recommend allowing Chrome to become your default browser.

Navigate to the `Chrome > Preferences` by pressing the `Command` + `,` keys at the same time. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Show advanced settings...** link.

Scroll down a bit more until you find the **Send a "Do Not Track" request with your browser traffic** and check the box.

**TIP:** You may want to consider installing an [ad blocking extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) to Chrome.
